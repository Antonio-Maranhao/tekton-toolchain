# Getting Started with Tekton in the IBM Cloud
The IBM cloud has supported devops and CI/CD for decades.  The IBM Cloud devops is built on open Toolchain and pipelines.  Pipeline has recently been expanded to include open source [Tekton](https://tekton.dev/) pipelines.

## Before you begin
Navigate to the [tekton-toolchain](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/tekton-toolchain) GitHub repository and make a fork.  I will call out mine, https://github.com/powellquiring/tekton-toolchain, during the tutorial but use yours instead.

The following labs will introduce you to the ibm Tekton framework:
- [Lab 1 Getting Started](lab1-simple/README.md)
- [Lab 2 Parameters](lab2-parameters/README.md)
- [Lab 3 Workspaces](lab3-workspaces/README.md)
- [Lab 4 Git scripts](lab4-shared-git/README.md)
- [Lab 5 Example Upgrade](lab5-classic2tekton/README.md)
